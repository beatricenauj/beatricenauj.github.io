<h2>The <a href="Pvz.html">Future</a> of<a href="https://www.space.com/"> Space</a> Exploration</h2></b>
<h3 class="Theme"><i>Space exploration is the physical exploration of outer space, both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft.</h3>

<p>While the observation of objects in spaceóknown as astronomyópre-dates reliable recorded history, <br>
it was the development of large liquid-fueled rocket engines during the early 20th century that allowed <br>
space exploration to become a practical possibility.
</p>
<p>Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, uniting different nations <br>
and ensuring the future survival of humanity. 
</p>
<p>Space exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the  <br>
Cold War. 
</p>
<p>The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between  <br>
the Soviet Union and the United States; the launch of the first man-made  <br>
object to orbit the Earth, the USSR's Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957, and the <br>
first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on July 20, 1969 are often <br>
taken as the boundaries for this initial period.
